The AI engineer successfully transformed the  website into a sleek, responsive, and SEO-optimized React frontend application. The development followed an iterative approach, with significant user interaction for design and content. Key phases included initial mock-data frontend development, SEO implementation (meta tags, JSON-LD, sitemap), fixing routing issues, and extensive design adjustments based on user feedback. The color scheme evolved from blue to green, then to indigo/purple, and finally to a custom palette, requiring numerous component updates. Navigation and layout were also refined for compactness and responsiveness. The current state reflects a visually consistent and functional frontend, with ongoing content and structural modifications based on the latest user requests.

The user initially requested a rework of  to be more sleek, attractive, and fully SEO-optimized, including sitemap, improved title, meta tags, descriptions, alt descriptions for images, JSON-LD markup schema, and a Google Analytics placeholder. The site content was to remain in Croatian, using placeholder information initially. Later, the user explicitly requested that the application remain frontend-only, with no database or backend implementation for now.

Subsequent refinements focused heavily on design and content:
1.  **Responsiveness:** The website must be fully responsive and compact for both desktop and mobile.
2.  **Color Scheme:** The initial blue/default colors were to be replaced first with green/dark green, then indigo/purple for some elements, and finally with a very specific custom palette (, , , , , , , , ), strictly prohibiting any other colors except white.
3.  **Navigation & Layout:** The header menu links were deemed too wide and the logo/title (PV Consulting d.o.o.) appeared in three rows, both needing a compact and improved layout.
4.  **Content/Data Updates:** Specific text changes for navigation links, contact details (phone, working hours, address, company details), removal of a Paket za mala poduzeća box, emphasizing text in the Građevinski inženjering section, reordering items, and updating the Google Map address.
5.  **Functionality:** Footer links should scroll to the top of the page upon navigation.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a Full-stack architecture with React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. However, the current work is exclusively focused on the frontend, with backend and database development deferred.

The frontend is a React application set up with Create React App (likely via craco due to  scripts). It uses Shadcn UI components located in  and Tailwind CSS for styling. Environment variables are managed via  files.

**Directory Structure (Relevant Frontend Parts):**


-   : Stores frontend environment variables, notably  and  (placeholder).
-   : The main application entry point, setting up  and defining all application routes. It was modified multiple times to add new routes and correct routing order for dynamic pages. It also now includes  for SEO.
-   : Global CSS for the application, defining some base styles and responsive adjustments, including color variables. It was significantly updated for custom color palettes and mobile responsiveness.
